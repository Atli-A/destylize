# Destylize
A work-in-progress browser extensionn to replace stylized unicode "fonts" with accessible ASCII text

## Problem
Many social media sites and other platforms don't let users select the font or otherwise customize their posts. For this reason, it has become popular to replace normal ASCII characters with Unicode equivalents of a given style. Text can be made to look bold, italic or hand-written this way, but the system isn't perfect. Particularly, it introduces problems for accessibility tools and older devices which don't support such characters, or expect them to have a different meaning.

## Solution
Replace all characters commonly used for this purpose with their ASCII equivalents. I suspect this problem will get much more complicated as I dig into it, but even this dead-simple approach is already showing some promising results.

## How you can help
Before I release a version of this extension to the Firefox or chrome stores, I'd like to get some feedback on if it's actually useful and what features it needs. I'm not personally a user of screen readers or other accessibility tools, so feedback from people who are is crucial for me to get this project going in the right direction. Feel free to open a GitHub issue, tweet or DM me at [@__wmww](https://twitter.com/__wmww), Reddit message me at [u/william01110111](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=william01110111) or email me at wm@wmww.sh. Feedback is welcome whether or not you've downloaded and run the extension.
